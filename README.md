# ProducerConsumer-BigFarm

##Author - Francesco Dore ( @FranzDore on GitHb )

Please note that the following project was written as an exam for an italian university. Therefore, variable names, comments and so on will be written in Italian.
Code is written in C: it solves the Producer-Consumer problem by using the C libraries and primitives for locks, condition variables, semaphores and shared memory.
Use is free for whoever wants to use it as a case study or wants to make it better either by cleaning it up or making it more efficient.
