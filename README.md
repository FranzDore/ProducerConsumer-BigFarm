# ProducerConsumer-BigFarm

## Author - Francesco Dore ( @FranzDore on GitHub )

The code was written for a project in university. It's a simple Producer-Consumer scheme.
The project was written in C, using imported primitives and libraries of the C language.
Use is free for anyone who wants to study the basics of the Producer-Consumer paradigm, or wants to make it more efficient or "clean".
Please note that the code is thought as a project for an italian university, so comments, markdown, variables names and so on will be written in Italian.
